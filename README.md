Triangle


Class ID: Lillipup

SRS ID: CST116SRS04

Unresolved Issues:  

     Did not complete last two Triangle configurations, SSA, and SSS. For triangle #4 I was not able to get 
the arcsin function to operate as expected in order to solve for one of the unknown angles. Script will still run without error, 
however, it does not generate the proper values for angle B and therefor produces the wrong values for angle C.

Notes:

Purpose:  

Learn to use conditional statements. 



Instructions:  

Create a project named "Triangle" that calculates the sides and angles of a triangle.  

Prompt the user for the configuration type of a triangle to solve: AAA, AAS, ASA, SAS, SSA, SSS.  

https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-solving-triangles.html

Prompt the user to enter the values they know based upon their selection of triangle configuration.  

Display all possible values for the triangle sides and angles. If the sides are only proportional (case AAA), note that in the answer.  

All angles are to be in degrees (not radians).  

If a solution is not possible, output "Unsolvable".  

For AAA, you only need to prompt for 2 angles. Calculate the 3rd.  

Tips:  

Work on one type of triangle at a time.  
Note in your README.md any solutions you couldn't complete in time.
